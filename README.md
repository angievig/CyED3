**Universidad Icesi**
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used in the course **Computación y Estructuras Discretas 3** at Universidad Icesi.  
The notebooks include tutorials and worked examples that complement the topics covered in class.  
They are updated weekly throughout the semester.

## Preliminary work in Python
This folder contains notebooks suggested for students to review and reinforce their Python knowledge applicable to this course.
* [Intro to Python](./Preliminary/IntroAPython.ipynb) This is a small notebook for an introductory overview.
* [Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python) The course content is based on Google's internal intensive 2-day Python training program.
* [Intro to NumPy](./Preliminary/Tutorial_Numpy.ipynb)
* [Pandas Tutorial](https://github.com/angievig/Pandas-Tutorial/tree/master)

## Week 1
This week, the practical session was delivered by Prof. Andres Aristizabal via Zoom. The assignment for the practical class is the following notebook: 
* [Regular Expressions Notebook](./Week1/RegExExercises.ipynb) This notebook contains many problems and some solutions

## Week 2

**Session 1**

We reviewed the concepts of regular expressions and their relation to regular languages.  Also, the lecture included an introduction to Automata theory.  The notebooks for this lecture are the following:
* [**Solution** to the Regular Expressions Notebook](./Week2/SolRegExExercises.ipynb). Solution for the previous exercise.
* [Previous Follow-up](./Week2/CyEDIII_Seguimiento1_25-2_G1.ipynb).  This notebook contains the problems assigned in the previous term.
* [Follow-up 2026-1](./Week2/CyEDIII_Seguimiento1_26_1_G5.ipynb)

## Week 3
**Session 1**

In this section we studied the concepts, definition and differences between:

* FDA
* FNA
* EFNA



**Session 2**
* [Automata Implementation in Pyforlang](./Week3/AutomataImplementation.ipynb)
* [Data for the assignment](./Week3/transacciones.xls)
* [Problem](./Week3/problem.md)

## Week 4
**Session 1**

In this session, we will work on **Transducers**. You will learn the formal definitions, explore some examples, and implement them using `pyformlang`.  Available resources for this class:

- [Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNqvrmT8=/?share_link_id=168929229680)  
- [Notebook with implementation examples](./Week4/Transducers.ipynb)
- [Problem statement](./Week4/Problem.pdf) 
- [Data for the problem](./Week4/students.csv) 


**Session 2**

**Follow-up 2:** Design and implementation of automata using `pyformlang`
