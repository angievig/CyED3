    "# Regular Expressions in Python (Follow-up 1)\n",
    "<font size=\"3\">For this follow-up you must solve 2 exercises using the theoretical knowledge you have gathered in class and 3 more exercises using Python regular expressions. For the Python section you will have to also present a written summary, in english, of how was your trend of thought to solve the exercise (one paragraph). This part will be marked taken into account the regex, the explanation and the number of cases passed. Each of these exercises must be solved using regular expressions, any other approach, even if it works, won’t be accepted.</font>\n",
